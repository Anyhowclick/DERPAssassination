## Python code for the game DERP:Assassination on Telegram.

This game was first conceptualised in October 2016. It has been a solo project up till now. After half a year of development, I considered switching to Node.js / Golang, but decided to stick to Python still. For now, the code that I've written may not be pretty, so I'm planning to rewrite a fair chunk of it, this time taking into consideration future expansions.

 For now, I hope what's explained below will make my code easier to read, and if not, most of the codes have been commented to give a somewhat better understanding. 

- Admin.py
  - Basic spam detection, and contains the function to check whether someone is an admin of a group
- Agent.py
  - Contains common attributes shared by every agent character, such as health, damage, attack methods, reset_for_next_round() etc.
- AgentClasses.py
  - A subclass of agent, to differentiate between the 4 classes: Offense, Tank, Healer and Support. It also contains query handling methods, which honestly should be separated into another file.
- CallbackHandler.py
  - Handles all callback queries (/agents command) and queries from all games.
- ChatManager.py
  - Router to commandHandler.
- CommandHandler.py
  - Contains all non-game related commmands (/about, /support etc.)
- Database.py
  - To store variables accessible to other files. Most important is DB, because it stores game objects and agent objects.
- Game.py
  - Game object to facilitate the game.
- GameHandler.py
  - Handles game-related commands, namely /join, /killgame and /newgame
- Heroes.py
  - Subclass of AgentClasses. Each individual agent and ability is stored here. 'Heroes' is used because 'Agent' was used already xD
- Main.py
  - Run this file with a bot API token obtained from theBotFather.
- Messages.py
  - Contains all text messages to be sent by the bot. Will contain the translations as well.
- README.md
  - This document!
- Shield.py
  - Shield object for an agent. *Newest feature*
